## Problem Statement

The election is a fundamental pillar of a democratic system, which enables the public to express their views in the form of a vote. Due to their significance in our society, the election process should be transparent and reliable to ensure participants of its credibility.
Online voting is a trend that is gaining momentum in modern society. It has great potential to decrease organizational costs and increase voter turnout. It eliminates the need to print ballot papers or open polling stations—voters can vote from wherever there is an Internet connection. Despite these benefits, online voting solutions are viewed with a great deal of caution because of:
?	Eligibility: Only legitimate voters should be able to take part in voting. 
?	Nonreusability: Each voter can vote only once. 
?	Privacy: No one except the voter can obtain information about the voter’s choice. 
?	Fairness: No one can obtain intermediate voting results. 
?	Soundness: Invalid ballots should be detected and not taken into account during tallying. 
?	Completeness: All valid ballots should be tallied correctly.
Blockchain technology came into the ground to overcome these issues. It offers decentralized nodes for electronic voting and is used to produce electronic voting systems for their end-to-end verification advantages. This technology is a replacement for traditional electronic voting solutions with distributed, non-repudiation, and security protection characteristics.

In this use case, three parties are involved:
1.	Voting Admin
?	Start election
?	End election
?	Show results
2.	Voter
?	Register a new voter
?	Vote for the candidate
?	Delegate the voting right
?	View voter details
3.	Candidate
?	Register a new candidate
?	View the list of candidates
?	View candidate details
